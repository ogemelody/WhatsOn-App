# 🚀 WhatsOn  

## 🏗 About the Project  
This repository is the result of a collaborative learning experience where we built an event recommender using python.
Our focus was not only on coding but also coming up with a MVP at a short period.  

## ✍️ Project Description

The goal is to build an innovative WhatsApp-based service. The project aim to deliver interactive, real-time communication through WhatsApp, integrating multiple APIs to enhance user engagement.

## 🚀 How it Works
The user input the Location and Day of the desired event they ⛳️want to attend. Just like the screenshot below, the User typed **Prague Tomorrow**, then the bot goes on to ask about the kind of events, in this case the user input **Any**. Now 5 events happening at the specified day and location will be suggested.
